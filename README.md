In this project, we evaluated measurement uncertainty using analytical error propagation and Monte Carlo simulation. The area of ​​the circle is considered: A = πr^2.
The radius r is assumed to contain a measurement error with a normal (Gaussian) distribution. Since the physical quantities measured in real life cannot be known precisely, many small and independent effects from the device, environment, and human factors cause measurement errors. Errors of this type are generally modeled with a normal distribution using the Central Limit Theorem. The analytical error propagation and Monte Carlo simulation applied in the project are compared. In the results, the area distribution approximately expresses a normal structure. The standard deviation generated by Monte Carlo is consistent with the analytical result. This indicates that the analytical approach is valid for this problem.

✅ Conclusion
Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful method for understanding uncertainty dispersion. It is an efficient and effective method for testing the validity of analytical results. It is particularly used in nonlinear models, in cases of large uncertainties, and when analytical solutions are difficult.
